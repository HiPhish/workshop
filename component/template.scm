(define-module (component template)
  #:export (template))

;;; A template takes page data and transforms it into (potentially) other page
;;; data. Page data is a dictionary structure (here an association list) where
;;; the key is the name of a particular datum (such as the title).
;;;
;;; A template reads some entries from its input data and writes entries to the
;;; output data. It may overwrite existing entries or add new entries. For
;;; example, a template might alter the title of a page or add page-specific
;;; CSS files to the page.

;;; The DSL allows us to specify which entries we want to read from the input
;;; data and what entries to add to the output. The first argument is a list of
;;; entry keys to bind. The remainder are (key value) pairs of entries to add.
;;; The values can refer to input values through the above defined bindings.

    ;; values will use the binding, not the field expression.
