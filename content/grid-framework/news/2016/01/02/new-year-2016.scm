      " this means that version 2.0 will not be API-compatible with previous
      versions.  This is a clean cut, but it will result in a leaner and
      cleaner API for users as well,  and everything  removed from the old API
      will  have an almost 1:1  equivalent. If you cannot migrate to 2.0 the

      system.  So what does a coordinate system do? It can convert coordinates
      for example.  What it does  not do  is  render  itself  or  align
      objects.  It *can*  be used  for such purpose,  but that not what it does
      itself.  And yet these tasks make up a big part of the code, especially
      in hexagonal grids with their many shapes.")

      does a similar thing for meshes:  the `Mesh` class does not render the

      renderers,  making it very easy for users to swap out renderers or even
      write their own ones.")

  	  regression at first, but the gain in productivity from leaner and more
  	  readable API will easily make up for the few extra lines of code.")
  	(h3 "You ain't gonna need it")
  	(p

  	  would be able to call a method on any grid and it would always  do what
  	  you would expect it to do. Sadly some concepts  just don't make sense for
  	  every grid. Take as an example "
  	  (em "scaling")
  	  " an  object to  the  grid.  This makes  perfect  sense  for a
  	  rectangular grid because an  object's "
  	  (code "Transform")

  	  honeycomb,  a circle or a sphere?  It just does not make sense to ask
  	  such a question. I will have to see what to keep and what to just throw
  	  out.")

  	  actual value. Those will be moved to dedicated classes, giving you a
  	  nicer API to work with and make the code more maintainable.")
  	(p
  	  "At the moment I'm refactoring the renderers out,  this will already
  	  shave off a huge chunk  of code.  Then I'll see  what's next,  I don't
  	  want  to cut off too much, but on the other hand  if I don't cut it off
  	  now it will have to wait for version 3.0.")
  	(h2 "Grid Framework for other engines")
  	(p
  	  "2015 has seen a big change in how game engines are licensed.  Unity Pro,
  	  Unreal 4 and Source are now available free of charge for development.
  	  This is a great opportunity to port Grid Framework to those engine as
  	  well. This has been a big motivator  as well for  starting version 2.0,
  	  now that all the  original goals have been met.  Currently all the
  	  classes are too dependent on Unit's API. With smaller classes and a
  	  cleaner API it is much easier to keep different codebases in synch
  	  feature-wise.")
  	(h2 "In summary")
  	(p
  	  "I don't have to  announce anything in regards  to other engines yet,  I
  	  want to finish the  move to version  2.0 first  and solidify  the API.
  	  In the meantime there is no reason  to wait for 2.0 if you want to be
  	  productive,  the features to be dropped have  proven themselves  to be
  	  barely useful  anyway and the rest will have pretty  much 1:1
  	  equivalents.  The 1.x code is  not defective,  it is just large, so don't
  	  worry about using the old API.  And as I said, the upgrade will be free
  	  to existing customers.")))
