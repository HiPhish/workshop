title: The examples on the websites are working again
category: organisation
---

The following the recent [rewrite] of the website, interactive [examples] on my
website are working again. Click the title link of any example and you will be
taken to a page where you can try it out in the embedded Unity HTML player (it
might take a while to load, so please be patient).

The gist of why they were broken is that in the past I had been using [Pelican]
as my static site generator, and I kept stretching it more and more beyond what
it was intended for. Eventually things started falling apart and files slipped
through the cracks, requiring me to manually patch things up after even the
smallest change. Now I am running my own static site generator which I have
tailored specifically to my needs.
