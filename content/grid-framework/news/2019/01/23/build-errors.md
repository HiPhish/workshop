title: For those who are having build errors
category: progress
---

I have been informed that some users are getting compiler errors when building
a game for release. A fix has been submitted already, but as usual it will take
a while for it to get approved. If you are affected by this issue drop me a
line, the problem can be resolved withing less than a minute. This will tie you
over until the update gets approved.
