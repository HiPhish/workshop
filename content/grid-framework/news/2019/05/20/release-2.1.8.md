title: Grid Framework version 2.1.8 released
category: release
---


Grid Framework version 2.1.8 has been approved by the Asset Store. This release
fixes errors when building a project that uses Grid Framework, a bug introduced
by the previous release.

Background
----------

In version 2.1.7 I improved integration with the Unity editor, and in doing so
I made use of some classes which are only available when the code runs in the
editor, but not when the project is actually being built. This meant that
during normal testing everything worked fine and the bug slipped through the
cracks both on my end and when the Asset Store team approved the package.

I only spotted the problem by accident when I looked at the Asset Store page
and saw people leaving bad reviews without contacting me first. I used to check
the page more frequently in the past, but it turned into an unhealthy
obsession, so I stopped doing it. Here is my appeal: if you have a problem
please contact me, usually the problem can be solved within a few minutes or
hours at most. You get a working product instead of wasting your money, and I
get to know that something is wrong.

To make matters worse, I had submitted the fix back in January, but it must
have gotten stuck on Unity's end. There is not much that I can do now, other
than apologise, since the damage has already been done. If you were affected by
this issue please give Grid Framework another chance and let me know
immediately if you encounter any issue. You deserve a working product for your
money.
