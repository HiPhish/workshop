  '(p "Use arrow keys to scroll the camera, hold shift to scroll faster. The
       grid's rendering range is only adjusted when the  camera reaches the
       edge of the grid, and that prompts the grid to re-calculate its points.
       This gives us the illusion of a seemingly endless grid while we only
       render what's within close reach. This is cheaper performance-wise than
       rendering a huge grid when the player will only see a small part of it
       at any given time."))
