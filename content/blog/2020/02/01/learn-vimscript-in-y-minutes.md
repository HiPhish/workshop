[My article] for the website [Learn X in Y minutes] about Vim scripting has
been accepted; the article teaches you how to get started with Vim's built-in
custom scripting language in a very concise manner. It has been quite an
enjoyable topic to write about and I even ended up learning a few new tricks
myself.

Learn X in Y minutes is a website hosting community-written quick introductions
on various programming languages and computer science concepts. Writing that
article has helped me get a better grasp on Vim Script and I hope future
Vimmers find it useful as well.

I would also like to thank everyone who has helped proofread my article in the
[original pull request]. Your comments helped refine my writing and I
appreciate every one of your criticisms.
