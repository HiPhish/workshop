I have written a [Common Lisp completion
source](https://gitlab.com/HiPhish/ncm2-vlime) for
[NCM2](https://github.com/ncm2/ncm2/), built upon
[Vlime](https://github.com/l04m33/vlime/). It provides asynchronous Common Lisp
completion and should work in both Vim and Neovim, depending on how well NCM2
and Vlime themselves work.

The plugin is hosted on GitLab with a GitHub mirror provided for convenience.
Enjoy.
