  `((p "When I first learned about rotation matrices they appeared quite
       “magic”; if you squinted your eyes a bit it sort of made sense, and if
       you did the math you could prove that the matrix does indeed perform the
       rotation and that all the group properties are met, but none of that
       explains " (em "where") " that form comes from, " (em "why") " it works.
       In this blog post I will explore a way to derive the formula for
       rotation matrices step by step.  If you wish to follow along you need
       only basic knowledge of linear algebra and trigonometry.")

         used our knowledge of trigonometry to find a solution. Once we had our
         simple solution we extended our problem domain to that of arbitrary
         points and the scaling of vectors, and looked for ways to extend our
         simple solution to that new domain.")

         we have is a group structure, which allows use to use all results from
         group theory as well. There is actually much more to rotation
         matrices, but that would be beyond the scope of this post. I mainly
         wanted to show how one can come up with this formula that usually just
         appears like “magic” by starting with a simple base case and then
         further generalising from there.")))
